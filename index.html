        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <h3>By: Tupac</h3>
        <p>I loved the song Changes since I was kid. This song holds a powerful message that is still prevelant to this day. Pac's lyrics tackle deep issues like racism and poverty, and his passionate delivery makes it personal. </p>

        <h2>No Role Modelz</h2>
        <h3>By: J Cole</h3>
        <p> I love the song No Role Modelz, because it’s catchy, honest, and full of meaning. The beat is smooth, his flow is effortless, and the lyrics mix humor with real talk about relationships, fame, and the lack of true role models.</p>
